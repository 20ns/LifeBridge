## About
LifeBridge AI is a production-ready, multilingual communication platform designed for hospitals, clinics, and emergency responders. The system delivers near-instant, context-aware translationsâ€”including sign-language recognitionâ€”while meeting strict regulatory requirements such as HIPAA. Built on AWS Serverless technologies, LifeBridge AI scales automatically and remains cost-effective within the AWS Free Tier.

---

## Features
### Medical-Grade Translation
* Real-time speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, and text-to-text translations covering **more than half of the world**.
* **Sign-language detection** (static and dynamic gestures) for critical medical commands.
* **Context preservation** for medical terminology and abbreviations.

### Compliance & Auditability
* End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256 at rest via AWS KMS).
* Immutable audit trail stored in Amazon DynamoDB Streams + S3 Glacier for 7 years.
* Automated **PHI redaction** and configurable data-retention policies.

### Human-in-the-Loop Quality Assurance
* Integrated **review dashboard** for medical professionals.
* AI-assisted quality scoring, bias detection, and hallucination mitigation.
* <30-second escalation workflows for life-threatening scenarios.

### Offline & Edge Readiness
* Local phrase bank for **10 emergency scenarios** with zero connectivity.
* Progressive Web App (PWA) support and intelligent caching.
* Graceful degradation with on-device fallback models.

### Analytics & Impact Metrics
* Real-time KPIs: translation accuracy, response latency, cost savings.
* Exportable analytics (JSON/CSV) for hospital EHR and BI systems.

---

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* **Node.js â‰¥ 20** and **npm â‰¥ 10**
* **AWS CLI** configured with a least-privilege IAM user
* Optional: **Serverless Framework** (`npm i -g serverless`)

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/lifebridge-ai.git && cd lifebridge-ai

# 2. Frontend
$ cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000

# 3. Backend
$ cd ../backend && npm ci && npm run build
$ npx serverless offline start                 # Local API at http://localhost:4000

# 4. Tests (all packages)
$ cd ../tests && npm ci && npm test
```

## Deployment
| Environment | Command                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dev**     | `npx serverless deploy --stage dev`                       |
| **Prod**    | `npx serverless deploy --stage prod` *(HIPAA Hardening)*  |

After deployment, run `scripts/deployment_verification.py` to perform post-deployment health checks.

> ðŸ’¸ **Cost-Aware**: The default `dev` stack remains within AWS Free Tier limits.

---

## Compliance & Security
LifeBridge AI incorporates best practices outlined in the [AWS HIPAA Security & Compliance whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf).

Key controls include:
* **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit; AES-256 + KMS at rest.
* **Logging**: CloudWatch Logs with VPC Flow Logs for network visibility.
* **Access Control**: IAM least-privilege policies and scoped resource tags.
* **Incident Response**: Automated alerts through PagerDuty + AWS SNS.

## Roadmap
- [ ] **FHIR Integration** for direct EHR connectivity
- [ ] **Edge Deployment** on AWS IoT Greengrass for field hospitals
- [ ] **Multilingual Triage Bot** powered by Bedrock Chat API
- [ ] **ISO 27001 Certification** audit & gap analysis
