# Migration to Amazon Translate

## Overview
This branch migrates the LifeBridge translation service from Amazon Bedrock to Amazon Translate for improved cost-effectiveness and performance.

## Changes Made

### Core Migration
- **Translation Service**: Replaced Amazon Bedrock with Amazon Translate
- **Language Detection**: Integrated Amazon Comprehend for language detection
- **Service Architecture**: Maintained existing API interface for seamless transition

### File Changes
- `backend/src/services/bedrock.ts` â†’ `backend/src/services/translate.ts`
- Updated all handler imports to reference new service location
- Modified package.json dependencies

### Dependencies Updated
**Removed:**
- `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime`

**Added:**
- `@aws-sdk/client-translate`
- `@aws-sdk/client-comprehend`

## Benefits

### Cost Optimization
- Reduced operational costs compared to AI model inference
- Pay-per-character pricing model more predictable for translation workloads

### Performance Improvements
- Faster response times with dedicated translation service
- Reduced cold start latency
- More consistent translation quality

### Reliability
- Mature AWS service with high availability
- Better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Simplified debugging and monitoring

## API Compatibility
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API endpoints remain unchanged
- **Same Response Format**: TranslationResult interface maintained
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing client integrations continue to work

## Testing
- Added `test-translate.js` for integration testing
- Verified all TypeScript compilation passes
- Confirmed all handler imports work correctly

## Deployment Notes
- Ensure AWS permissions include Translate and Comprehend services
- No environment variable changes required
- Serverless deployment configuration remains unchanged

## Future Considerations
- Easy migration path back to AI-powered translation if needed
- Can be enhanced with custom translation models in the future
- Foundation for multi-provider translation support
