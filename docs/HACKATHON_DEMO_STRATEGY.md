### **Medical Impact**
- **7 critical emergency gestures** supported
- **6 emergency scenarios** with validated protocols
- **10+ languages** with cultural medical terminology
- **116+ medical scenarios** tested and validated

## üè• **Story-Driven Use Cases**

### **Primary Story: "Maria's Emergency"**
> "3 AM. Maria, who speaks only Spanish, rushes her 5-year-old to the ER. He's having trouble breathing. The on-call doctor doesn't speak Spanish. In traditional scenarios, precious minutes are lost finding a translator. With LifeBridge AI, the doctor instantly understands Maria's urgent descriptions through real-time translation, while Maria sees the treatment plan explained in her native language. The child receives immediate care."

### **Secondary Story: "David's Silent Emergency"**
> "David, a deaf construction worker, suffers a workplace injury. Paramedics arrive but can't communicate the severity. David uses LifeBridge AI's sign language recognition to indicate 'EMERGENCY' and 'PAIN' - instantly translated to 'URGENT: EMERGENCY - I need immediate medical help' and 'Severe pain in chest area.' Clear communication saves critical time in his treatment."
