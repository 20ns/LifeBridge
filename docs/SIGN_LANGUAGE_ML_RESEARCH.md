# Sign Language ML Enhancement Research

## Overview
This document outlines the research and implementation plan for enhancing LifeBridge's sign language functionality with machine learning capabilities while staying within AWS free tier limits.

## Current Implementation
LifeBridge already has:
- MediaPipe Hands integration for real-time hand detection
- Basic gesture recognition (emergency, help, pain, medicine, water, yes, no)
- AWS Lambda backend processing
- Medical context-aware translation
- Integration with Amazon Bedrock Nova Micro

## Research: Sign Language Datasets

### 1. Medical Sign Language Datasets
- **ASL-LEX**: American Sign Language lexicon database (free, research use)
- **MS-ASL**: Microsoft American Sign Language dataset (1,000+ signers, 25k+ videos)
- **WLASL**: Word-Level American Sign Language dataset (2,000+ words, 21k+ videos)
- **LSE-Sign**: Spanish Sign Language dataset
- **Medical ASL Dictionary**: Free medical terminology in ASL

### 2. Hand Pose Datasets
- **FreiHAND**: Large-scale hand pose estimation dataset
- **InterHand2.6M**: Large-scale dataset for 3D interacting hand pose estimation
- **HanCo**: Hand pose estimation dataset with contact annotations
- **RHD**: Rendered Handpose Dataset

### 3. Recommended for Medical Use
- **Medical ASL Dictionary** - Specifically for healthcare contexts
- **WLASL subset** - Filter for medical/emergency terms
- **Custom medical gesture collection** - Build our own dataset

## Pre-trained Models Research

### 1. Available Models (Free/Open Source)
- **MediaPipe Hands** (already implemented)
  - Real-time hand landmark detection
  - 21 hand landmarks per hand
  - Runs on device (no AWS costs)

- **OpenPose Hand**
  - Alternative to MediaPipe
  - More computationally intensive
  - Better for complex gestures

- **Hand Pose Estimation Models**
  - MobileNet-based models
  - Lightweight for real-time use
  - Can run on AWS Lambda (free tier)

### 2. Sign Language Recognition Models
- **Sign Language Transformer** (Hugging Face)
- **TSPNet** (Temporal Sign Language Recognition)
- **I3D-based models** for video classification
- **LSTM + CNN hybrid models**

### 3. AWS-Compatible Models
- Models that can run on SageMaker free tier
- Lightweight models for Lambda deployment
- Models compatible with Amazon Bedrock

## AWS Free Tier Constraints

### SageMaker Free Tier
- **25 hours/month** of t2.medium or t3.medium instances
- **250 hours/month** of t2.micro instances
- **50 GB** of EBS storage
- **5 GB** of S3 storage for SageMaker

### Strategy for Free Tier Usage
1. **Model Training**: Use t2.medium for 25 hours/month
2. **Inference**: Deploy lightweight models on Lambda
3. **Data Storage**: Use S3 free tier (5GB)
4. **Model Hosting**: Use Lambda instead of SageMaker endpoints

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Hand Detection (Week 1)

- [ ] Add confidence scoring improvements
- [ ] Implement gesture stability algorithms
- [ ] Add medical gesture validation

### Phase 2: Dataset Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Download medical ASL terminology dataset
- [ ] Create training data pipeline
- [ ] Set up S3 storage for datasets
- [ ] Implement data preprocessing

### Phase 3: Model Enhancement (Week 3)
- [ ] Set up SageMaker environment (free tier)
- [ ] Train lightweight gesture recognition model
- [ ] Optimize for medical contexts
- [ ] Validate with medical terminology

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 4)
- [ ] Deploy enhanced model to Lambda
- [ ] Update frontend for better accuracy
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend (React) -> MediaPipe Hands -> Lambda (Sign Processing) -> Bedrock (Translation)
```

### Enhanced Architecture
```
Frontend (React) -> Enhanced MediaPipe + ML Model -> Lambda (Enhanced Processing) -> Bedrock (Medical Translation)
                 -> SageMaker (Model Training) -> S3 (Dataset Storage)
```

### Components to Implement

1. **Enhanced Gesture Recognition**
   - Temporal smoothing algorithms
   - Medical gesture validation
   - Confidence calibration
   - Multi-hand support

2. **ML Pipeline**
   - Data preprocessing service
   - Model training pipeline (SageMaker)
   - Model versioning system
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Medical Context Enhancement**
   - Emergency gesture prioritization
   - Medical terminology validation
   - Context-aware translations
   - Audit trail for medical use

## Free Tier Optimization Strategies

### 1. Efficient Resource Usage
- Use Lambda for inference (not SageMaker endpoints)
- Optimize model size for faster cold starts
- Implement caching for repeated gestures
- Use S3 Intelligent Tiering

### 2. Cost Monitoring
- Set up billing alerts
- Monitor SageMaker usage hours
- Track Lambda invocations
- Optimize data transfer

### 3. Fallback Strategies
- Current MediaPipe as fallback
- Graceful degradation for complex gestures
- Offline mode for basic gestures
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up SageMaker development environment
   - Download and evaluate medical ASL datasets
   - Test enhanced MediaPipe configurations
   - Implement improved gesture stability

2. **Research Validation**
   - Test model accuracy with medical staff
   - Validate emergency gesture recognition
   - Benchmark against current implementation
   - Gather user feedback

3. **Documentation**
   - Create medical gesture guide
   - Document model training process
   - Write deployment procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guide

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: >95% for emergency gestures
- **Latency**: <500ms processing time
- **Stability**: Consistent recognition over time
- **Medical Validation**: Approved by healthcare professionals
- **Cost**: Stay within AWS free tier limits
