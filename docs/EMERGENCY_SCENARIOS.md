  severity: 'critical' | 'urgent' | 'moderate';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  symptoms: string[];
  timeframe: string;
  phrases: string[];
  quickActions: {
    assessment: string[];
    treatment: string[];
    communication: string[];
  };
  communicationFlow: {
    step: number;
    action: string;
    phrases: string[];
    timeLimit?: string;
  }[];
  criticalIndicators: string[];
  contraindications: string[];
}
```
